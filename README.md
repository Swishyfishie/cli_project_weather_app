# Cli::Project

Welcome to my weather-app gem

## Gems required
HTTParty
Pry (optional, for debugging)

## Usage

In order to run the app, execute the 'run' file from the bin folder.
Instructions to use this app will be provided as you enter input in the terminal.

First input will be about the measurment system. Use 'C' for Celsius or 'I' for the Imperial system.

Second input will be your city name

Third input will be the country name and this is optional.
NOTE: Although optional, it's recommended that you type in the name of the country 'United Kingdom' or 'UK' as if there are more than 1 cities in the world with the same name, the program might not return the one you want. For some reason, US is prioritised when it comes to that.

Example: If you type in London without a country, it will return the London from the US.


Commands available : 
    temp - checks the temperature
    wind - checks the wind speed
    alert - checks for severe weather alerts
